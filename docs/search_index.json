[["index.html", "College Admission Statistics Chapter 1 Introduction", " College Admission Statistics Saili Myana, Sai Rithvik Kanakamedala 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Every year, thousand of students from all over the world apply to the universities in the US. Both of us being from India, the college admission process is very different in the US. In India, one standardized test is used to decide what college and major you get to do. But the college admission process in the US is more holistic, and includes diverse assessment, both quantitative and qualitative, of each students profile. This prompted the question - How do we select the ideal college for our higher education?, as opposed to in India, where the college options are limited based on your test scores. Both of us being International students, the university shortlisting process of applying for higher education was grueling. We grappled with the question of selecting the best university according to our needs and, further, what are our chances of getting into such universities. For this purpose, it is common to use rankings given by reputed organizations based on academics or even other rankings based on Return on Investments. Nonetheless, these rankings aren’t extensive enough to meet our precise requirements, and we end up doing our own research. This leads us to our research topic, “Comparing college statistics.” The project can be unraveled into a two-pronged problem: 1. How do colleges compare in terms of academic resources, research, finances, and other factors impacting the competitiveness of a university? 2. How do admitted students of top colleges compare? For the first part, we analyze the data of tuition fees, financial aid given, number of applicants, application requirements (GPA/recommendations/secondary schools), acceptance rate, student-to-faculty ratios, graduation rates, and other factors. For the second part, we analyze the SAT and ACT test scores of admitted students along with the student demographics (gender, race/ethnicity) for different degree levels.

Both of us being International students, the university shortlisting process of applying for higher education was grueling. We grappled with the question of selecting the best university according to our needs and, further, what are our chances of getting into such universities.

How do admitted students of top colleges compare? For the first part, we analyze the data of tuition fees, financial aid given, number of applicants, application requirements (GPA/recommendations/secondary schools), acceptance rate, library sizes, number of programs offered, student-to-faculty ratios, graduation rates, and other factors. For the second part, we analyze the SAT and ACT test scores of admitted students along with the student demographics (gender, race/ethnicity) for different degree levels. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 Selection of Data Source For our project, we searched for US colleges statistics as we focused on US colleges’ admission process. We decided to analyze Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which contains all the college-level information we need. This is collected by NCES for all colleges in the US, hence we decided this is reliable and adequate data for our analysis. The other datasets we found were subsets of this data. This was the most extensive dataset that could be used to analyze, explore and visualize, to answer our question of “How do we select the ideal college for our higher education?” We also use the US News college rankings to further analyze top colleges’ statistics. There are many rankings based on different criteria that are not too different from each other. This source for ranking can be replaced with any other. 2.2.2 Data Collection Process The U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) maintains the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The IPEDS Data is collected annually by conducting multiple interrelated surveys of about 6400 colleges and universities that participate in the federal student aid program. We are using 2019-20 data for our project. This data is updated every year. 2.2.3 Data Format The yearly data is available in a Microsoft Access Database format, where the file contains multiple tables that contain information on admissions statistics. We also have the metadata tables that clearly explain each data table, its variable names, and the data types. The categorical variables are numerically encoded, and the descriptions of the encoding are also present in the dataset. 2.2.4 Data Extraction The data for each year is present on the NCES website in the form of zipped files. We can download the Access database for each year by clicking on the links that are available on the above website and extracting the files from the zipped folder. After downloading the access file, which contains multiple tables, we can do the following steps to extract the data into R studio from the Access database: Open a new excel spreadsheet and go to the Data section In the Data Section, select From Access and then select the access file and the tables you want to export to the Excel/CSV file. As the data is updated every year, we can download the yearly data from the NCES website and follow the same steps above to extract the data into (Excel spreadsheets or CSV files) and use RStudio to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. The pipeline of this workflow is easily reproducible for future years, and hence we chose this method to extract our data. 2.2.5 Data Quality For each year, NCES releases the data twice - the first being provisional data and then the final data. The provisional data has been said to undergo all the NCES data quality control procedures. This is released after each year. The final data includes the revisions institutions make. This is released after two years. Since the data itself is collected from surveys answered by institutions, there is an inherent unsureness/skepticism about the correctness of the data. As we saw this year, Columbia University acknowledged giving false data for the US News ranking, attributing it to outdated methodologies. For our purpose, we assume the correctness of the data reported in surveys. We can contact NCES if we have any questions about the data that is collected. 2.2.6 Sources https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/download-access-database https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/09/columbia-usnews-college-ranking/ "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources In our search for US colleges statistics, we focused on the US colleges’ admission process. The U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects such data annually. We decided to analyze Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which contains all the college-level information we need. It is collected by conducting several interrelated surveys from about 6,400 colleges, universities, and technical and vocational institutions that participate in the federal student aid programs, hence we decided this is reliable and adequate data for our analysis. The other datasets we found were subsets of this data. This was the most extensive dataset that could be used to analyze, explore and visualize, to answer our question of “How do we select the ideal college for our higher education?” For each year, NCES releases the data twice - the first being provisional data and then the final data.

ADM2019: This table contains information about the undergraduate selection process for entering first-time, degree/certificate-seeking students. This includes information about admission considerations, applicants, applicants that were admitted, and admitted students who enrolled. SAT and ACT test scores are included for institutions, that require test scores for admission. These data are applicable for institutions that do not have an open admissions policy for entering first-time students. Writing scores for both SAT and ACT are no longer collected. HD2019: This table contains directory information for every institution in the 2019 IPEDS universe. Includes name, address, city, state, zip code and various other information. We used it to match state and institute name with UNITID (which is used in all other tables). IC2019_AY: This table contains data on student charges for a full academic year. The price of attendance of full-time first-time undergraduates that are made available to the public on College Navigator are included in this table. Price of attendance includes amounts for published tuition and required fees, books and supplies, room and board and other expenses. SFA1819_P1: This table contains data on the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students and all undergraduate students who receive different types of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at each institution. DRVGR2019: Table contains the graduation rates derived from the graduation rate data for selected cohorts. Graduation rates grouped by gender are also provided. EF2019A: This table contains the number of students enrolled in the fall, by race/ethnicity, gender, attendance (full- or part-time) status and level of student. Each record will contain the total enrollment, enrollment for men and women, and the total enrollment and enrollment for men and women for all nine race/ethnicity categories. EF2019D: This table contains data on the total entering class, first-year retention rates and the student-to-faculty ratio. Student-to-faculty ratio is defined as total FTE students not in graduate or professional programs divided by total FTE instructional staff not teaching in graduate or professional programs. All data in this table are applicable only to institutions with undergraduate students. Retrieving data from Microsoft Access Database: We need to install the 64-bit database engine from: microsoft. This download will install a set of components that can be used to facilitate transfer of data between 2010 Microsoft Office System files and non-Microsoft Office applications. We use the odbcDriverConnect function from the RODBC library to transform the data from access database format into a usable dataframe in R. We didn’t require any data cleaning or transformation before EDA.

For this step, we use plot_missing function from redav library. We remove all the rows with missing values in IC2019_AY, SFA1819_P1. But, in the case of DRVGR2019, there are a lot of rows with missing values only from column GBA4RTT(Graduation rate - Bachelor degree within 4 years, total). Hence, we will create two dataframes. One which removes missing values from men and women graduation rates to analyze. Next, we remove the missing values in total graduation rate to analyze the total statistics. Next, we save the cleaned datasets in the Data folder to use for further analysis. ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in IC2019_AY&quot; ## [1] 3535 3 ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in SFA1819_P1&quot; ## [1] 3987 4 ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in DRVGR2019_A&quot; ## [1] 3659 4 In total, there are 8 continuous variables in the 3 tables (IC2019_AY, SFA1819_P1, DRVGR2019_A) combined, and a UNITID column which is the ID for each college. HD2019 has no missing values and has 2 categorical variables and UNITID columns. 3.3.2 Table: ADM2019 Now, we deal with the missing values in ADM2019 table. First we use the plot_missing function from redav library to visualize missing patterns. (The function outputs a graph with overlapping axes and we were not able to read the x-labels. So we copy-pasted the code and rotated the x axis labels by 90 degrees, and changes the size of labels accordingly for our data) ENRLT is the total number of enrolled students, and ENRLM is the total number of enrolled men; the rows starting with SAT and ACT give the 25th percentile and 75th percentile scores in tests, and these are a main part of our analysis. Without these values, we cannot form meaningful hypotheses, so we are removing the schools that didn’t provide these data. After this, our missing values look like this: ## ENRLPTM ENRLPTW ENRLPT ENRLW ENRLFTM ENRLFTW ADMSSNW UNITID ADMCON1 ADMCON2 ADMCON3 ADMCON4 ADMCON5 ADMCON6 ADMCON7 ADMCON8 ADMCON9 APPLCN ## 187 186 184 3 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## APPLCNM APPLCNW ADMSSN ADMSSNM ENRLT ENRLM ENRLFT SATNUM SATPCT ACTNUM ACTPCT SATVR25 SATVR75 SATMT25 SATMT75 ACTCM25 ACTCM75 ACTEN25 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ACTEN75 ACTMT25 ACTMT75 ## 0 0 0 The majority missing values are in Part time student enrollment statistics. These are not very pertinent to our analysis, so we are dropping these columns. Enrollment of men and total enrollment determine the women enrollment (based on responses from majority colleges), so dropping this column too, and calculating it using (Total enrollment - men enrollment) instead. After this, only missing values are 3 rows in full-time enrollment of men. These 3 rows are dropped to get a cleaned dataframe. This dataset is now saved in the Data folder for further analysis. ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in ADM2019&quot; ## [1] 1089 36 In this table, there are 9 categorical variables, and 26 continuous variables and a UNITID column which is the ID for each college. 3.3.3 Table: EF2019A, EF2019D As seen earlier, there is no missing value in EF2019A table, the dataset is directly saved in the Data folder. As seen earlier, there is one missing value in EF2019D table, we dropped it to clean the dataset and saved it in the Data folder. ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in EF2019A&quot; ## [1] 118917 35 ## [1] &quot;Number of rows, columns in EF2019D&quot; ## [1] 5884 2 There are 4 categorical variables and 30 continuous variables in the EF2019A table, and 1 continuous variable in the EF2019D table, along with the UNITID column. In total, our datasets have 15 categorical variables and 65 continuous variables (some of these are dependent on other variables) and a common UNITID column for each college. Note: There are other tables that have processed admission statistics like percent yields in admission for each gender, etc, but we are using the raw data tables collected from the surveys only, and analysing this data.

This points to no bias in the college admission process. In addition, we see that on average, percentage of women applicants is 57% as opposed to the 42%-43% in men, and this trend is carried onto the admitted students. 4.2 Acceptance rate When applying for colleges, one of the key principle is to not put all your eggs into one basket. We divide the colleges we apply into Reach, Fit and Safety colleges or you might have heard of Dream, Target and Safety schools. No matter what you call them, the principle is to increase your chances by applying strategically. For this purpose, we look at acceptance rates of different colleges. Acceptance rate of a college is the percent of students that are admitted out of the students that applied. This shows that very few colleges have an acceptance rate below 25%, and these very selective schools are expected to be higher ranked colleges. We further analyse the admission statistics and college resources for these colleges againt the remaining colleges. These colleges are stored in a new dataframe acc20. The remaining schools have high acceptance rates, around 75%. Higher acceptance rate points to lower applications or higher admissions or both. ## [1] &quot;Only 54 colleges have an acceptance rate below 25 percent.&quot; 4.3 Admission yield To compare colleges, we analysed the admission yield of each college. This is the percentage of students that enrolled at the college out of all students that were admitted. A higher admission yield means most students that are admitted end up enrolling at the college. This plot shows that colleges with higher acceptance rate (probably higher rated colleges) have higher yield than most of the other colleges that are clustered around the yield of 20%. But yield also has a tradeoff with the cost of attendance of the univeristy. The admission yield is expected to be lower when the cost of attendance goes up. This is what we see when the colleges with lower acceptance rate have a lower yield than expected due to higher cost, and colleges with higher acceptance rate have a higher yield than expected due to lower costs. We will analyse costs of attendance in more details further in this project. 4.4 Test Scores Test scores are one of the most important statistic in ones application, to show their quantitative and verbal skillset. SAT and ACT are the two standardized tests that every highschooler takes. The cummulative 75th percentile scores in these tests for applicants to each college are reported in the survey. First we analyse the SAT statistics of colleges, againt their acceptance rate. This plot clearly shows two clusters, one where the average SAT scores are around 1200 for the majority of the colleges and a second smaller cluster above 1500 SAT score for the lower acceptance rate colleges. This supports our hypothesis earlier. The colleges with high SAT scores in the applicants pool are the top ranked colleges, that also have lower acceptance rates. The interactive component will further look at the SAT and ACT statistics for individual colleges. 4.5 Application requirements While deciding to apply to colleges, we first look at the requirements of the colleges we want to apply to. Our data has requirements for each colleges in 9 fields, Secondary school GPA, Secondary school rank, Secondary school record, Completion of college-preparatory program, Recommendations, Formal demonstration of competencies, Admission test scores and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). We decided to analyse the 3 of these that are most important and analysed how they varied for different colleges. Req - Required Con - Considered but not required Rec - Recommended No - Neither required nor recommended We see that test scores are either required or considered but not required. Hence, it is suggested that students submit their test scores to improve their chances of admission. For recommendations, it feels like similar proportion of the schools recommend and require it as those schools that dont require it. There are very few colleges that consider but don’t require test scores and require secondary school rank. The portion of the mosaic plot corresponding to no requirement of test scores, recommendations, and secondary school rank is larger than expected. 4.6 Racial diversity analysis To understand the racial diversity of American Colleges, we visualized box plots for percentage of students of each race. Hisp - Hispanic AfrAm - Black or African American AmInd - American Indian or Alaska Native NatHaw - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander This shows that percent of students White is the majority, with the highest median. Hispanic and African American races are similar, and the next biggest proportion. Asian follows, with very small representation for American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Further, we analysed the racial diversity along with gender for an average american college. We did this by aggregating the percentage of students of each gender and race across all colleges. From this plot, we can see that men and women have the same diversity across all races, with women being slightly more in number than men in all races. This is consistent with our initial observation on gender diversity, with women being more in number than men on average, both in applicants and admitted students. 4.7 Student-Faculty Ratio Student to Faculty ratio is often an important metric to compare colleges, with colleges having a lower ratio being more student friendly than a higher ratio. We compared this ratio for the top colleges with lower acceptance rates as seen above, with ones that have a higher acceptance rate. Majority of the colleges have a ratio of around 20, with very few having a ratio above 40. As expected, the top colleges (with low acceptance rates) have low student-faculty ratios, showing that they have better resources for their students. 4.8 Cost of attendance analysis First, we compare the costs for in-state and out-of-state students. We observe that the cost of attendance for in-state students peaks at a clearly lower value than that for out-of-state students. This clearly favors applying for a few in-state colleges to have a lower cost option. We can further observe that for the top colleges (with lower acceptance rates), both the in-state and out-of-state cost of attendance is high, other than a few outliers. Further, it looks like almost all high costing colleges are these top colleges. This is consistent with what we expect. The top colleges have higher tuition and fees that also acts as a barrier and causes them to have lower yields as we saw above. We now visualize the effect of geography (state of the college) on the cost of attendance. We see that states in the north-east have higher average costs of attendance. This maybe due to higher cost of living in NY and surrounding areas. West-cost and east-coast have similar costs with colleges in central America having the lowest costs. This is also a guide to select colleges according to one’s budget. 4.9 Graduation rate analysis We tried to see how many enrolled students graduate within 4 years This shows that majority of the students of top colleges (with low acceptance rates) graduate within 4 years. The 4 year graduation rate is significantly higher in top colleges compared to the rest. Most colleges have graduation rates below 50% whereas top colleges often have graduation rates above 75%. Comparing the graduation rates between men and women: Most of the points lie above the y=x line, showing that graduation rates for women are greater than men in a majority of the colleges. The data also shows rounding, as percentages are often rounded to the nearest integer. 4.10 Institutional aids and grants We visualized the Average amount of institutional grant aid awarded to full-time first-time undergraduates and Number of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded institutional grant aid for each college. We can observe that the colleges that award grant aid to large number of students tend to give a lower amount of aid and colleges that give high amount of aid, award grants to low number of students. Further, majority of the top colleges give the highest amount of grants but to lower number of students. This is again in support of the top colleges, as they give their students higher grants. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component We first added the college names to the corresponding ADM2019 rows.

We have compared the top colleges against the rest in factors such as grants given, tuition fees and other costs, Student-faculty ratios, graduation rates, gender and racial diversity, acceptance rates and admission yields. We also understood the general requirements of colleges with respect to the secondary school rank, recommendations and submission of test scores of applicants. We further tried to answer how admitted students of top colleges look like, using the test scores on the interactive plot. You can find schools that have applicants with test scores close to yours, to explore colleges where you will have a good chance of getting admitted. 6.2 Limitations Out of all the tables we used, ADM2019 table contained some of our important plots like SAT and ACT scores, acceptance rates, admission yields and various admission requirements like GPA, recommendations etc. But less than 50% of the rows were complete. Further, about 18% of the rows had missing test scores, which were the basis of our interactive component. We had no way to impute these values, so we dropped those rows, resulting in many known colleges not showing up in our plots. 6.3 Future directions We did not analyse all the features of our datasets. We had the 25th percentile test scores, type of colleges like public/private, library resources, and many more features are still left unexplored. We can further clean the remaining tables and analyse them. We have the same type of data over the years, and analysing the trends of this data as time changes is the next step to explore. In the interactive plot, we want to further try to create a composite dashboard, where you can see acceptance rates, demographics of the college selected, etc. Our interactive component is a good starting point for a tool that can help college applicants shortlist colleges based on their interest. 6.4 Lessons learned Our datasets was not a single document but a compilation of many tables from different surveys. This made our data cleaning process challenging, as we needed to deal with every table in a different way. We learnt to combine such data from different sources to form cohesive observations.
