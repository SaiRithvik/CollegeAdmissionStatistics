It is collected by conducting several interrelated surveys from about 6,400 colleges, universities, and technical and vocational institutions that participate in the federal student aid programs. Basic information about the dataset: We have a Microsoft access database which contains multiple csv files. We use some of the files to analyze and draw conclusions to answer our question. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation We use the odbcDriverConnect function from the RODBC library to transform the data from access database format into a usable dataframe in R. We didn’t require any data cleaning or transformation before EDA. 3.3 Missing value analysis ## ACTEN25 ACTEN75 ACTMT25 ACTMT75 SATVR25 SATVR75 SATMT25 SATMT75 ACTCM25 ACTCM75 ## 840 840 840 840 791 791 791 791 757 757 ## SATNUM SATPCT ACTNUM ACTPCT ENRLPTM ENRLPTW ENRLPT ENRLFTM ENRLFTW ENRLM ## 722 722 722 722 588 535 523 148 127 115 ## ENRLW ADMSSNW ADMSSNM ENRLFT ENRLT ADMSSN UNITID ADMCON1 ADMCON2 ADMCON3 ## 111 104 94 39 23 18 0 0 0 0 ## ADMCON4 ADMCON5 ADMCON6 ADMCON7 ADMCON8 ADMCON9 APPLCN APPLCNM APPLCNW ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## CHG3AY3 CHG2AY3 UNITID ## 458 458 0 ## IGRNT_A IGRNT_N IGRNT_P UNITID ## 1922 294 294 0 ## GBA4RTT GRRTW GRRTM UNITID ## 3499 1774 1773 0 ## UNITID INSTNM STABBR ## 0 0 0 Duplicates ## [1] 0 ## [1] 0 ## [1] 0 ## [1] 0 ## [1] 0 Using plot_missing from redav library: (The function outputs a graph with overlapping axes and we were not able to read the x-labels.

Without these values, we cannot form meaningful hypotheses, so we are removing the schools that didn’t provide these data. ## ENRLPTM ENRLPTW ENRLPT ENRLW ENRLFTM ENRLFTW ADMSSNW UNITID ADMCON1 ADMCON2 ## 187 186 184 3 3 3 2 0 0 0 ## ADMCON3 ADMCON4 ADMCON5 ADMCON6 ADMCON7 ADMCON8 ADMCON9 APPLCN APPLCNM APPLCNW ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ADMSSN ADMSSNM ENRLT ENRLM ENRLFT SATNUM SATPCT ACTNUM ACTPCT SATVR25 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## SATVR75 SATMT25 SATMT75 ACTCM25 ACTCM75 ACTEN25 ACTEN75 ACTMT25 ACTMT75 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 The majority missing values are in Part time student enrollment statistics. These are not very pertinent to our analysis, so we are dropping these columns. Enrollment of men and total enrollment determine the women enrollment, so dropping this column too, and calculating it using (Total enrollment - men enrollment) instead. After this, only missing values are 3 rows in full-time enrollment of men. These 3 rows are dropped to get a cleaned dataframe. ## UNITID ADMCON1 ADMCON2 ADMCON3 ADMCON4 ADMCON5 ADMCON6 ADMCON7 ADMCON8 ADMCON9 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## APPLCN APPLCNM APPLCNW ADMSSN ADMSSNM ADMSSNW ENRLT ENRLM ENRLW ENRLFT ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ENRLFTM ENRLFTW SATNUM SATPCT ACTNUM ACTPCT SATVR25 SATVR75 SATMT25 SATMT75 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ACTCM25 ACTCM75 ACTEN25 ACTEN75 ACTMT25 ACTMT75 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 There are tables that have processed admission statistics like percent yields in admission for each gender, but we are using the raw data collected from the survey and analyzing.
