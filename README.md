In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis and visualization on College admission statistics.

Both of us being International students, the university shortlisting process of applying for higher education was grueling. We grappled with the 
question of selecting the best university according to our needs and, further, what are our chances of getting into such universities. For this purpose, it is common to use rankings given by reputed organizations based on academics or even other rankings based on Return on Investments. Nonetheless, these rankings aren’t extensive enough to meet our precise requirements, and we end up doing our own research.
This leads us to our research topic, “Comparing college statistics.”

The project can be unraveled into a two-pronged problem: 
1. How do colleges compare in terms of academic resources, research, finances, and other factors impacting the competitiveness of a university?
2. How do admitted students of top colleges compare?
